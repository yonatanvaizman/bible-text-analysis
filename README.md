Analyzing Biblical Texts

My hobby is learning about biblical texts. The Hebrew bible is a beautiful library of literature, and it is the basis for my Jewish heritage and culture and my native language - Hebrew.<br/>
Recently, I started combining my professional skills (AI, LLMs, NLP) to analyze biblical texts (the Hebrew origin and various translations).

- I started with a "playground", trying various things (theme discovery, training a tokenizer for biblical Hebrew script, pre-training a tiny LLM with biblical Hebrew/English language).
- Currently, I'm working on an Agentic AI assistant that will help me analyze biblical texts: [bibleAssistant](bibleAssistant)
